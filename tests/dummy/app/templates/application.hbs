        This picture is shown with some basic adjustments involving the application of css class manipulation. 
        The CSS is self-contained here but borrows from Bootstrap where possible (hell, I'm not a designer, don't 
        ya know).

      It's worth noting that while we've largely left the topic of "sizing" out of the conversation, the base ui-image CSS
      class does constrain the <code>max-width:</code> CSS selector to <strong>100%</strong> so the images dimensions are 
      less obviously different between the two images. This isn't a solution, just a side note.
    </desc>
    <desc>
      Also note that changing the image here effects all examples and you may want to try variations. Steve and the actress 
      happen to be square images whereas the Michele Obama image is rectangular (which can matter ... not just showing off my 
      mastery of geometry).

    <h3>Sizing Example 1 - Fill</h3>

        <div class="flex-item bordered-box" style="width:{{frameSize}}px;">
          {{ui-image src=imageSrc borderMask=borderMask size='fill'}}

          In many cases the image we're showing will be more of an photographic icon for an application. In this state 
          it's going to be relatively small(ish). How do we shrink such a legend as Steve Jobs? Well the easiest way is
          just to take only that space which is provided by the containing element.

          Frame Size: 
          <div class="col-xs-11">
            {{input type='range' min=25 max=400 step=25 value=frameSize}}              
          </div>
          <div class="col-xs-1">
            {{number-input width='50px' height='height' value=frameSize}}
          </div>
        </desc>
        <desc>
          All we're really doing here is changing the CSS selector from <code>max-width: 100%</code> to <code>width: 100%</code>.
          This just means that if we move to a slightly larger size than the image it will continue to scale it up to the size available.
          If that's ok then use the 'fill' option. If you leave it off it will stop scaling once it reaches it's full size. 
            
          <note>
            <strong>Note:</strong> 
            The green image has <strong>fill</strong> set, the red bordered image does NOT. Scale up to see variation.

      <h3 class="col-xs-12">Sizing Example 2 - Preset Sizes</h3>
       
      <examples class="flexy">
        <columns>
        <column style="margin: 15px">
        {{ui-image src=imageSrc borderMask=borderMask size=magicSizePreset}}      
      </column>
      <column>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <desc>
        Another option is to state a specific size from a set of standardized presets. The first batch you'll see below match up with 
        Bootstrap nominclature (largely) as well as our own <code><a href="http://development.ui-icon.divshot.io/">ui-icon</a></code>, 
        <code><a href="http://development.ui-button.divshot.io/">ui-button</a></code>, and 
        <code><a href="http://development.ui-input.divshot.io/">ui-input</a></code> addons. They say consistency 
        is the hobgoblin of simple minds but what do they know ... hum de dum. What was I saying? 
      </desc>
      <desc>
        Just kidding. The Emerson quote really said "<em>foolish</em> consistency" and there's nothing foolish about being consistent in UI controls.
        I say that just in time to make a small departure from consistency and into "extension" ... yes because images are sometimes used as "icons" 
        the prior consistency was appropriate but sometimes we want images to be proper "images" which means they ought to be bigger. Right? Well we 
        thought we'd add two larger "standard sizes" as you'll see below.
      </desc>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <desc>
        Sizes: {{ui-bs-button-choice choices=sizePresets selected=sizePreset}}
      </desc>
      <desc>
        Here you're going to want to switching to the Michelle Obama image. Oh no! She's pinched! Yes, that's because we're forcing both width
        and height to same sizes. That kinda makes sense for "icon" images to give them a very uniform look and feel. Come on Obama looks pretty 
        good pinched at these smaller sizes, right? Right. But for portrait and above it can get awkward. One might think someone with poor photoshop
        skills was trying to make Michelle thinner (not that she needs it ... she look great from this authors perspective).
      </desc>
      <desc>
        So what are we going to do about this? Well if you'd like to release the square constraint just add a ".unconstrained" to the <code>size</code> 
        property and you're all set.
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        {{ui-toggle-button icon='chevron-right' on='unconstrain me' off='square me' value=squareConstraint}}

        \{{<strong>ui-image</strong>&nbsp;img='{{imageSrc}}' size='{{magicSizePreset}}' {{#if borderMask}}borderMask='{{borderMask}}'{{/if}} }}

  <examples class="flexy">
    <columns>
      <column style="margin: 15px">
      {{#if useSize}}
        {{ui-image src=imageSrc borderMask=borderMask size=explicitSize}}             
      {{else}}
        {{ui-image src=imageSrc borderMask=borderMask width=explicitWidth height=explicitHeight}}

    <column>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <desc>
        For the control freaks out there -- we know you're out there -- you can of course just STATE what height and width you'd like.
        Raw numbers are converted to 'px' measurements but you can state whatever units you prefer. The only choice is which property/properties you'll
        set. It's a big world but you're a big person ... go ahead and choose between:
      </desc>
      <desc>
        {{#if useSize}}
          Size: {{text-input value=explicitSize width='70px'}}         
        {{else}}
          Width: {{text-input value=explicitWidth width='70px'}} 
          Height: {{text-input value=explicitHeight width='70px'}}          
        {{/if}}
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
        {{ui-toggle-button value=useSize on="use width and height properties" off="use size property instead"}}
      </desc>
      <desc>
        To ease your troubled heart, let me explain that setting 'size' sets BOTH height and width properties at the same time. All three properties 
        use the values you provide to set the "style" attribute (using Ember's <code>htmlSafe()</code> of course).

          img='{{imageSrc}}'

        {{/if}}{{#if borderMask}}borderMask='{{borderMask}}'{{/if}}
